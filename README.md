## Abstract


## Model

- PIN
- APIN
- GPIN

best score: 0.93 R2
## TO-DO

- [x] see each MLE is equal tp sum of MLE
- [ ] it is possible to normalize data in order to have one model for all
see to contact professor

## Parameter range

Surrogate model are defined inside some specific range of parameter. PIN model in this surrogate library have been trained inside the range defined the table below.
The surroate can not estimate PIN probability with parameters outside of this range of parameters.

| Parameter | Min | Max
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
| alpha  | 0  | 1
| delta  | 0  | 1
| u  | 0  | 200
| epsilon buys  | 0  | 300
| epsilon sells  | 0  | 300
